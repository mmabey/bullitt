	\section{Introduction}
	The goal of the project is to design and implement a file sharing system capable of distributing the storage of files among VMs whose users have access to them, ensuring consistency across all VMs with a copy of any file, to restrict access to files in the system according to the permissions stored by a file index server, and to protect the transmission of all files' contents by encrypting their contents.  The accomplishment of this goal is primarily realized through the use of the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol (AMQP), a public-key infrastructure (PKI), and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
